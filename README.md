# ManhuntCompass
MC Manhunt plugin - create a compass that tracks a player

Create .jar, insert into your spigot server as you would any other plugin

Type `/compass PLAYER_NAME_HERE` to get a compass that tracks that player.
Right-click the compass to set to current location. Compass only changes position when you right-click.

Compass will be returned on death.

You can create multiple compasses for different players, and any players can make a compass.
Must be `op` and a player to run the `/compass` command. Will not work in console.
